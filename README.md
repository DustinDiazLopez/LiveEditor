## LiveJS - SITM
Just having some fun with [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)

### Editor [Demo](https://dustindiazlopez.github.io/LiveJS/):
By live editor, I mean two people once connected via PeerJS can write on a textarea simultaneously.

### Tic Tac Toe [Demo](https://dustindiazlopez.github.io/LiveJS/tictactoe.html):
The Tic Tac Toe Game with friends... FROM AFAR :D

## How to...
Once you are in the demo, copy your Peer ID and share it with someone else. They then should paste it into the provided input space and click connect.
